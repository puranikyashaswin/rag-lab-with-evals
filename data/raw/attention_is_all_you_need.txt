The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, our model (big transformer) achieves 28.4 BLEU, outperforming previous state-of-the-art, including ensembles of recurrent or convolutional models. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it to English constituency parsing both with and without pretraining, achieving 92.7 F1 with pretraining.
